# NAICo_miniprojects
The goal of this project is to answer the questions in 'Back-End and AI Projects.pdf' File. The AI part is designed to study and predict the daily BTC price. The second part is more related to working with databases using 'Node.js'. There is a report included in both AI and Backend folders, which describes the results of each section.
